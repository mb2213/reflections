git did not install.
Had to re-boot system, then try to install....took forever to install program to start

sublime costs 70$ wth? why are you recommending a program that costs 70$

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

Some applications are not designed for version control. Software development
frequently (almost always in oo) have multiple files that are related to each
 other although I can already see this "repository" idea will get really
 messy really fast in a large application.


Where did my previous change go to?

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 Writing code.
