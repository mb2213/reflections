What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 Create the git metadata for the version control repository. nothing is checked
 into the repository. you need to mkelem youself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

 The staging area is an intermediate step to get a file into the source control
  system. you can have files i the Working directory that are not in the staging
  area, nothing is IN source control yet.
