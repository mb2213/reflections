When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 When you are working on a project with other individuals, who do not have access to your repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 You might pull in changes that you do not want; changes that were made by other individuals. You only want to sync when you are ready to sync


 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Fork is when you take someones stuff and want to retain their contribution, you want to add to their project.
 Clone is when you copy a repository, local or remote
 Branch is when you want to make local changes to a repository without changing the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 Keeps you up-to-date with changes from other contributers.
